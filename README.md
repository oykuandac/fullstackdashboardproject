# fullstackdashboardproject


## Description

This project is built by following the "Full Stack Project: Spring Boot 2.0, React.js, Redux" project of Udemy. This project provides a dashboard that can be used by any user to manage their projects. Users can register, log in to the system and add, update, delete projects in this dashboard. Each user has its own project board.

## Assumptions

I created the CRUD operation of Project, Project Task, Backlog, and User entities. 
I used the MySQL database to store these entities and their information.
I used IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, and Mysql Workbench environment. Also, I used Maven to import dependencies.

## Possible Improvements

1) Users may have a profile page that holds the personal information of the user.
2) Forget Password? section can be added.
3) The first time we run the app on the web browser, it works slow. After the first time, it gets speed up. That might be fixed.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### IntelliJ

I run the application.java file in IntelliJ IDE to run the server.

### ./mvnw

With this command, the app can be run on Linux.
